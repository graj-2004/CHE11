            <h1>What is Global Warming?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere. This trapped heat leads to a warming of the planet, causing changes in climate patterns and an overall rise in temperatures.
                
                <br><br>The primary contributors to global warming are human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy, deforestation, industrial processes, and certain agricultural practices. These activities release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and leading to an imbalance that results in a warming climate.</br></br>
                
                The consequences of global warming include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe heatwaves, changing precipitation patterns, melting glaciers and ice caps, and shifts in ecosystems and wildlife habitats. The scientific consensus is that human activities are the main driver of the observed global warming trend, and addressing this issue requires international cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Efforts to combat global warming often involve transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, reforestation, and implementing policies to reduce emissions.</p>
