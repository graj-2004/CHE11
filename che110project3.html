            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>1. Burning of Fossil Fuels:</strong><br>• Coal, Oil, and Natural Gas: The combustion of fossil fuels for energy in power plants, industries, and transportation releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. This is the leading contributor to the enhanced greenhouse effect.</li><br>
                <li><strong>2. Deforestation:</strong><br>• Emission of Greenhouse Gases: Certain industrial activities release potent greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Methane, in particular, is significantly more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a shorter time frame.</li><br>
                <li><strong>3. Agricultural Practices:</strong><br>• Methane Emissions from Livestock: Ruminant animals, such as cows, produce methane during digestion. Large-scale livestock farming contributes to elevated methane levels in the atmosphere.<br>• Nitrous Oxide from Fertilizers: The use of nitrogen-based fertilizers in agriculture releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere.</li><br>   
                <li><strong>4. Waste Management:</strong><br>• Landfills and Waste Decomposition: Decomposing organic waste in landfills produces methane. Inadequate waste management practices contribute to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</li><br>
                <li><strong>5. Use of Fluorinated Gases:</strong><br>• Industrial and Consumer Products: Certain human-made gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), have high global warming potentials. They are used in various industrial applications, including refrigeration, air conditioning, and electronics.</li><br>
                <li><strong>6. Land Use Changes:</strong><br>• Altered Surfaces: Changes in land use, including urbanization and agricultural expansion, can affect the reflection of sunlight (albedo) and contribute to changes in regional climates.</li><br>
                <li><strong>7. Transportation:</strong><br>• Vehicle Emissions: The combustion of gasoline and diesel fuels in cars, trucks, airplanes, and other forms of transportation releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere.</li><br>
