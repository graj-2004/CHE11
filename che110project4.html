                <li><strong>1. Rising Sea Levels:</strong><br>•Melting Ice Caps and Glaciers: Higher temperatures lead to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, contributing to the rise in sea levels. This poses a significant threat to coastal areas, low-lying islands, and deltas.</li>
                <li><strong>2. Extreme Weather Events:</strong><br>•Intensified Heatwaves: Global warming is associated with more frequent and severe heatwaves, which can have profound impacts on human health, agriculture, and ecosystems.<br>•Increased Storm Intensity: Warmer ocean temperatures can fuel more powerful and destructive hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones, leading to increased risks of flooding and damage to coastal regions.</li>
                <li><strong>3. Changes in Precipitation Patterns:</strong><br>•Droughts and Water Scarcity: Altered precipitation patterns can result in more prolonged and severe droughts in certain regions, affecting water supplies for agriculture, communities, and ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>4. Ocean Acidification:</strong><br>•The absorption of excess carbon dioxide by the world's oceans leads to acidification. This can harm marine life, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as corals and some shellfish.</li>
                <li><strong>5. Impact on Ecosystems:</strong><br>•Shifts in Habitats: Changes in temperature and climate patterns can force plant and animal species to migrate or adapt to new habitats, affecting biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.<br>•Disruption of Ecological Relationships: Global warming can disrupt the timing of natural events (phenology), leading to mismatches between the life cycles of interacting species, such as predators and prey.</li>
                <li><strong>6. Threats to Biodiversity:</strong><br>•Species Extinction: Habitat loss, changes in temperature, and other climate-related factors increase the risk of extinction for numerous plant and animal species. Fragile ecosystems, such as coral reefs and Arctic ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable.</li>
